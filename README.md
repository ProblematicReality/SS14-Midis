Random assortment of compiled MIDI files from the internet intended to be used in Space Station 14 or any other platform that supports MIDI. 
Please help me sort this I have 21,000 MIDI files to sort into appropriate folders and many to most are unlabeled with source origin. I don't know where stuff is from besides looking up the name and hoping for the best.

Includes Cynthia to make sorting for good MIDI easier. Or to listen to for fun if you're like me. https://www.blaizenterprises.com/cynthia.html
